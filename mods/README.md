* Test1 seems to work for Pterodactyl career
* Test2 is no-go
* Test3 is in-progress Farmer trait
  * Farmer trait has 1 buff: "trait_farmer buff", which confers:
	  * `commodity_Trait_Autonomy_LovesOutdoors`
	  * Loot on instance:  `loot_Statistic_LifeSkill_Responsibility_Trait_GainSmall`
	  * 1 new continuous loot: "MUST FARM!":
		  * Adds +8 stress any time the sim is not gardening and it is day (this is not great, as sim is too stressed to garden...)
